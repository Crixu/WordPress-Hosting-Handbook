# About the Hosting Team

## What does the Hosting Team do?

The Hosting team works to improve the WordPress user experience across hosting environments through user collaboration and education.

Although, in principle, it is focused on those people responsible for WordPress in hosting companies, all those system administrators, programmers or interested in the world of web hosting are invited.

## When does the Hosting team meet?

The hosting team meets at Slack -wordpress- #hosting-community on Wednesdays at 09:00 UTC (9 a.m.) and 18:00 UTC (6 p.m.). The conversations are in English. Check out the Meeting calendar for the current schedule.
